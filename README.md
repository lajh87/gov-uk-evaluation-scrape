The goal of scape-gov-uk-evaluation is to scrape results from a search of gov.uk for the term 'evaluation' filtered by 'research and statistics' content type. It then downloads the associated documents and returns match to user defined keywords in `data-raw/keywords.txt`.

Note the raw data weighed in at 10gb and is not uploaded to this repository due to github file size limits. It is saved on my onedrive and can be made available on request.

Note the scripts in the data-raw package can take several hours to run.
